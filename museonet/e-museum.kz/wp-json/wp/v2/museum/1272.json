It was founded in 1915 based on rare private collections of local enthusiasts and first opened in the People\u2019s House of the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk. The establishment of the museum gave a new impetus to the systematic collection, preservation, and promotion of the historical, cultural, and natural heritage of the region. Over its nearly century-long history, the museum has become one of the largest cultural centers, bringing together monuments of nature and human history of East Kazakhstan - from ancient times to the present day. In addition, it is an important research institution engaged in the scientific study and popularization of the archaeological, ethnographic, and historical aspects of the Rudny Altai. Today, the museum\u2019s collection holds more than 147,000 items of historical and cultural value. Each year, the collection is enriched by approximately 3,000 new exhibits. More than 15,000 authentic items are on permanent display.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum possesses one of the largest and most scientifically significant archaeological collections in Kazakhstan, comprising over 80,000 artifacts. This collection has been formed as a result of many years of field research conducted by renowned archaeologists, including S.S. Chernikov, A.N. Maksimov, F.Kh. Arslanova, Z.S. Samashev, A.A. Tkachev, G.A. Bush, and A. T\u00f6leubaev.<\/p>\r\n<p>A special place among the archaeological finds belongs to the golden artifacts discovered in the burial mounds of Berel, Shilikty, and Eleke Sazy. These items are outstanding examples of Scytho-Saka art and have received high acclaim in the global academic community.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum\u2019s main and traveling exhibitions cover materials related to various eras - from antiquity to ethnographic and modern cultural periods. The archaeological department features unique complexes from the Turkic era, including artifacts from the burial mounds of Zevakin, Kyzyl-Tas, Karashat I\u2013II, Bobrovka, Vydrikha, Vasilievka, and Kyzylkayin.<\/p>\r\n<p>An open-air exhibition area displays a collection of Turkic stone statues (balbals) found in East Kazakhstan. These monuments reflect the religious beliefs and artistic traditions of the Turkic peoples.<\/p>\r\n<p>The East Kazakhstan Regional Museum of History and Local Lore is a true chronicle of the region's cultural heritage. Exhibits of high scientific and artistic value from its collections offer vast opportunities for in-depth study of the history not only of Kazakhstan but of all Central Asia. The museum is equipped with modern scientific infrastructure and is continuously expanding its activities in the fields of research, cultural education, and tourism.<\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/24679cec-0967-42e5-96ec-f286ee05b571.jpeg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/ec0e95ce-9547-4b1d-affe-56ef8d67a20c.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/97fa59e6-4063-455f-819b-af91e4d19971.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6d283d28-4b8a-4ece-a94b-053c8fb219e3.jpg"],"work_hours":"9:00-18:00","ticket_price":"500","is_active":"1","site":"olketanu-shko.kz","address":"","addresscity":"\u0433.\u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u041a\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 40","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1272","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1272\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32725,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1272\/revisions\/32725"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1272"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=1272"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
