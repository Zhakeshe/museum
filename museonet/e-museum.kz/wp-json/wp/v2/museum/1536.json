The museum's primary area of specialization is regional studies. Its mission is to collect, preserve, and promote valuable materials related to the region\u2019s history, ethnography, archaeology, agriculture, and culture.<\/p>\r\n<p>Established in 2022, the museum has since played an important role in researching and presenting the historical and cultural heritage of Zhetisay District to the public. The museum building covers a total area of 100.8 square meters and includes one exhibition hall and a storage room for the collection. The exhibition hall features significant artifacts that tell the story of the region\u2019s past.<\/p>\r\n<p>A notable part of the exhibition consists of personal belongings, awards, and documents of Heroes of Socialist Labor \u2014 Shablan Dildabekov, a World War II veteran and former director of the \u201cBolshevik\u201d state farm, and labor hero Dinasylbek Boribekov. The museum also holds medals, award certificates, and photographs of other World War II veterans from Zhetisay District.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of special interest are historical artifacts discovered at the medieval site of Utirtobe, located in the district. These items are considered valuable archaeological and cultural heritage objects. In addition, the museum exhibits musical instruments used in district cultural centers between 1965 and 1980, along with household items that reflect the cultural life of that era.<\/p>\r\n<p>The exhibition hall also features an ethnographic section showcasing a traditional Kazakh yurt and everyday items used by the Kazakh people. These include wooden utensils, seed storage containers, chests, samples of traditional clothing, carpets, alasha (woven rugs), and decorative woven bands such as bau-baskur. This ethnographic display plays a vital role in introducing visitors to the material culture and traditions of the Kazakh people.<\/p>\r\n<p>As of today, the museum\u2019s collection includes 2,037 registered items. The collection is continually expanding and maintained through scientific classification and systematic preservation efforts. The museum organizes traveling exhibitions, educational lectures, and thematic tours. This branch is one of the key cultural centers contributing to the preservation of the region\u2019s historical memory and the development of patriotic spirit among younger generations.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/f054f78b-b696-49a9-b21f-6fa4de0c3808.jpeg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/87bce2b6-2b18-47a1-a95e-d3a4671475cc.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/e3b24319-8ebf-4c09-9b98-afc0475d0353.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/9bdd2387-28af-4c4d-a27d-59ac68bcb169.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/299779e4-ff5f-4b89-a989-e73ec7245f8b.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/046b5e2e-64ec-4cac-926a-a740fa416052.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/b0fc0a60-aaae-4e9d-9447-50234290440e.jpg"],"work_hours":"09.00-18.00","ticket_price":"500 \u0442\u0433","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"\u0441.\u043e.\u0428\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0442\u0438 18","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1536","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1536\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32880,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1536\/revisions\/32880"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1536"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=1536"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
