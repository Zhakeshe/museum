In 1991, it was opened as a historical and local history museum. In 1991, after the 300th anniversary of the national hero Karakerey Kabanbay Batyr, in 1993 the museum was named after Kabanbay Batyr.<\/p>\r\n<p>The history of this historical building built in the village of Kabanbay is deep. At the entrance to the museum, there are two heads, which are divided into the right wing and the left wing. The house located in the left wing was the house of a rich merchant from Lepsi county. In 1935, when rich people were confiscated, their house was demolished and placed here. The house on the right wing is the headquarters of the Red Army. Both are made of logs. The wide hall in the middle connecting the two houses is made of red brick. Keeping these historical places, a museum was created at the request of the residents of the district.<\/p>\r\n<p>The total volume of the museum is 518.1 square meters. The size of the exhibition hall is 311 square meters. The number of materials of museum importance is 837, of which 348 are the main fund. The most valuable of them are presented in the exhibition halls. They are: Samauryn (1892), decorated kimeshek (19th century), silver earring (19th century), meat salad bowl (19th century), clay pot (10th century). The exhibits presented in the halls of the museum tell about the rich and beautiful nature and ancient history of the region, from the beginning to the independence. The museum consists of halls: \"Independent Kazakhstan\", \"Nature of our country\", \"Archaeology\", \"Kabanbay batyr\", \"History of the region during the Great Patriotic War\", \"Ethnography\".<\/p>\r\n<p>The first renovation of the museum was carried out in 2004. In 2010, the museum was completely overhauled under the state \"Road Map\" program. In 2011, museum halls were decorated.<\/p>\r\n","logo":"","museum_type":"","multimedia":[""],"work_hours":"","ticket_price":"","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"","addresscountry":"","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2106","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2106\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":31729,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2106\/revisions\/31729"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2106"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2106"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
