The museum was officially founded on May 11, 1979, by the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. Between 1975 and 1976, the institution operated as a district branch of the regional history and local lore museum. Construction of the current museum building began in 1979, and it opened its doors to visitors in 1982.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum was created based on valuable artifacts discovered during archaeological excavations of the ancient city of Otyrar and has since evolved into a scientific center that systematically studies and promotes the region\u2019s history, culture, and civilization. The total area of the museum complex is 3,048.5 square meters. It oversees 4 archaeological monuments of national significance and 216 monuments of local importance. Among them are significant historical sites such as the ancient cities of the Otyrar oasis \u2014 Otyrartobe, Kuryktobe, Kokmardan, Altyntobe, Aktobe, Zhalpaktobe \u2014 as well as the mausoleum of Arystanbab.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum's exhibition is divided into two main sections: archaeological and ethnographic. The archaeological section features artifacts dating from the Bronze Age to the 17th century. These include ceramic vessels, household tools, animal-shaped amulets (ram, dog, horse), remnants of agricultural and nomadic tools, containers for water and food storage, oil lamps, trays, jugs, buckets, and ceramic tiles. Of special interest are fragments of ancient water supply systems and bricks used in the construction of mosques and public bathhouses, which highlight the development of urban infrastructure. Artifacts from the later stages of Otyrar\u2019s history include fine porcelain, iron tools, gold, silver, and copper coins, carved wooden panels, and decorative tiles made of glass and terracotta.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ethnographic section is enriched with exhibits that reflect the daily life of the local population during the 19th\u201320th centuries. Displayed are items related to the nomadic lifestyle, tools for hunting and fishing, jewelry (gilded belts, earrings, rings, traditional jingling ornaments), musical instruments, tools of labor, and interior elements of the yurt. Additionally, the exhibition includes items that represent the spiritual worldview of the people and their traditional falconry practices.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum also houses a library named after Abu Nasr al-Farabi, containing over 3,000 publications, including the works of al-Farabi and his disciples. The museum is actively engaged in scientific research and restoration activities. In 2001, it collaborated with Japanese researchers to help restore the monuments of Ancient Taraz. As part of the state program \u201cCultural Heritage,\u201d the museum participated in the \u201cReviving Ancient Otyrar\u201d project, which included extensive archaeological research. As a result of expeditions along the Syr Darya River, nearly 30 previously unknown historical sites were discovered, and a 14th-century eastern bathhouse was restored. Recent archaeological work at the eastern gates of Otyrar has further enhanced the scientific value of the museum\u2019s efforts.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, the Otyrar State Archaeological Museum-Reserve is a unique scientific and cultural institution that plays a crucial role in shaping historical consciousness, preserving and promoting cultural heritage, and passing valuable knowledge to future generations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/12f01542-9916-49bf-adfe-6a1d41bb3479.jpg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/572261e3-20c9-4691-8f07-37009b9f73c8.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/49623b2c-0195-467f-a439-611313053f24.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/965542f7-c38e-4f15-91e2-1c0a5c187cc0.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/d3ea8818-7759-412a-8182-fcb63b52d7f5.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/4d8449f4-fd3a-4d10-8401-fb63fc98f82a.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/a0d055ef-e299-41fe-bbb7-1c7537d7b6c8.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/b936bdce-c6bc-428d-803c-08fb7dbb92a2.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/97db188e-f354-43be-a3d1-b3cafb49dba1.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/64866da2-1098-409c-8f1d-46e14dd01e09.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/d7bced73-b0ad-4efc-9abe-b279c70093b1.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/c087d42d-d901-42ce-967f-9d2cde4d7502.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/3ae94988-17c4-4bda-b884-ca8cf03d0b33.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6a6246de-d506-4ee3-b922-af4caa69dab4.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/9c195971-ab36-46f2-9c8f-f507e2e06da4.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/4f707c64-81e0-4f61-9f0e-42217782e97d.jpg"],"work_hours":"09:00 - 18:00","ticket_price":"200 \u0442\u0433","is_active":"1","site":"www.otyrarmuseum.kz","address":"","addresscity":"\u0428\u0430\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441.\u043e.","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u0416\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043a \u0436\u043e\u043b\u044b 1","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1260","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1260\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32890,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1260\/revisions\/32890"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1260"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=1260"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
