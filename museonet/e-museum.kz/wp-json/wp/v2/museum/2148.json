Initially, the institution functioned as a public museum dedicated to the history of the local collective farm. Later, it was named after Nurmolda Aldabergenov.<\/p>\r\n<p>The total area of the museum building is 3,978 square meters, with 9.2 square meters allocated to exhibition space. Today, the museum\u2019s collection holds 4,706 items of historical and cultural significance, and this number continues to grow each year.<\/p>\r\n<p>The exhibition is displayed across four main halls and four additional rooms. Thematic sections cover the following historical periods:<\/p>\r\n<p>1.\tThe socio-economic situation in Kazakhstan before the October Revolution;<\/p>\r\n<p>2.\tThe establishment of Soviet power and collectivization;<\/p>\r\n<p>3.\tThe development of the kolkhoz (collective farm) movement;<\/p>\r\n<p>4.\tThe life and socio-political activities of Nurmolda Aldabergenov.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the exhibition features materials about prominent historical figures of the Zhetysu region - batyrs, biys, and zhyrshys - such as Yeskeldy biy, Balpyk biy, and Kabylys zhyrshy.

One of the halls contains his bust and materials related to his childhood and mature years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another hall displays photographs and documents from the construction of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway and the early development of collective farms. Other rooms include exhibits illustrating the traditional lifestyle, crafts, and culture of the Kazakh people.<\/p>\r\n<p>A central exhibit of the museum is the sculpture of Hero of the Soviet Union Matai Bayisuly, a native of this village who showed heroic courage during the liberation of Ukraine in World War II.

The large hall showcases portraits of 19 Heroes of Labor, each accompanied by individual panels outlining their achievements.<\/p>\r\n<p>A special moment in the museum\u2019s history was the 1986 visit of Dinmukhamed Kunaev, who left a commemorative note in the museum\u2019s guestbook. The First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev, visited the village of Aldabergenov and the museum on three occasions - 1988, 1995, and 2002 - leaving personal messages in the guestbook. His congratulatory letter commemorating the 100th anniversary of Nurmolda Aldabergenov is also one of the museum\u2019s treasured artifacts.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Nurmolda Aldabergenov Memorial Museum is more than a tribute to a single individual\u2014it is a significant historical and cultural institution that offers deep insights into the development of agriculture in 20th-century Kazakhstan, the labor feats of its people, and the key milestones in the formation of statehood.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/57b2ee9b-be14-4c74-984d-de73c785cadc.jpg","museum_type":"","multimedia":[""],"work_hours":"9:00 - 18:00","ticket_price":".","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"","addresscountry":"","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2148","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2148\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":31945,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2148\/revisions\/31945"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2148"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2148"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
