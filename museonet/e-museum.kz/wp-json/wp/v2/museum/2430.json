The museum's exhibition features personal belongings of the People's Writer Hamit Yergaliyev, photographs and documents related to his creative journey, poetic works, translations, and valuable information about his role in the history of Kazakh literature.<\/p>\r\n<p>The main goal of the museum is to pass on Hamit Yergaliyev\u2019s rich spiritual legacy to future generations, to foster young people's interest in literature, to widely showcase the works of this outstanding representative of Kazakh poetry, and to promote patriotism, cultural, and spiritual values. In addition, the museum serves as an important center of enlightenment and spiritual education for literature enthusiasts. The history of the museum's creation began on May 22, 1998, following the Resolution No. 466 of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan \"On perpetuating the name of the poet Hamit Yergaliyev.\" In 2006, on the 90th anniversary of the poet\u2019s birth, the museum was officially opened. The total area of the museum is 88.8 square meters. Currently, the museum\u2019s collection holds more than 453 exhibits.<\/p>\r\n<p>The exhibition structure includes seven showcases:<\/p>\r\n<p>The first showcase contains photographs of Hamit Yergaliyev taken before he was sent to the front and after his return from the war as a squadron commander. His orders and medals from the Great Patriotic War are displayed in the lower section.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second showcase presents photographs of the poet with his contemporaries-writers and poets-as well as celebratory congratulatory letters.<\/p>\r\n<p>The third showcase tells the story of the museum's establishment. It includes official documents and photographs highlighting the stages of the museum's development.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the central part of the exhibition (on a special panel) are family photographs of the poet. In front of them is a table displaying his personal items and everyday belongings, as well as his clothing.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh showcases are dedicated to the poet's literary legacy. They display his poetry collections published over the years, translations, and articles printed in periodicals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Hamit Yergaliyev Museum is not only a place of remembrance but also a spiritual and cultural center pointing the way to the future. Today, it plays a significant role in promoting national literature and culture, as well as in educating the younger generation.<\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/4344bde6-8561-4b52-ac16-66e2cce5e0d2.jfif","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6b591a3d-b144-46cf-ac67-d7813edc5055.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6985f7da-9d8d-4f23-8d16-a390990dccee.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6f239f2d-f442-498c-9a13-724a1fc2b695.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/9e9ea46f-879e-4acc-841c-75d77cbe7f28.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/b8cd5ae3-4d88-4404-918e-a510b32b1418.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/292de52c-54a7-4f0b-9f3e-1d9346fa29a3.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/26806408-ec83-428a-bbcf-de6f36247459.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6028f20d-5b84-43f6-b5da-b2af5be81f95.jpeg"],"work_hours":"09.00-18.30","ticket_price":"\u043e\u0442 300 \u0442\u0433","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"","addresscountry":"","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2430","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2430\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32166,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2430\/revisions\/32166"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2430"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2430"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
