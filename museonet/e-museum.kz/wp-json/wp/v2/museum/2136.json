M. Tolebayev is a People's Artist of the USSR, laureate of the State Prize of the USSR, an outstanding composer, a classic of Kazakh music, one of the authors of the first National Anthem of the Republic of Kazakhstan. M. Tolebaev was born on March 13, 1913 in the village of Karashigan on the coast of old Balkash, in the \"Ulgi\" collective farm of Borlitobe district (now Sarkan district). The composer's father - Tolebay Uysinbayuly was a cattle breeder and farmer before the revolution, was one of the participants in the organization of the \"Ulgi\" collective farm, and his mother - Tazhibala Akshalovna, was a noble and honest person who did not offend anyone. That's why she is a talented mother who did not fit into the framework of old customs and got a chance to the art path with her own life and her own demands. The formation of any person, the definition of his civil qualities cannot but be influenced by his environment. At the same time, it is appropriate to mention that Mukan has been drinking from rich examples of oral literature since childhood. He grew up listening to many poems from his mother Tajibala, who was known as a lively debater, and his father's younger brother Apyrbay, whose name was well-known in the country, and the poems of the famous poet Kul. Undoubtedly, these people had an influence on young Mukan's passion for art and his later becoming a great composer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The foundation of the museum building opened in honor of such a talented and great composer was laid in 1941. From that time until 1983, it was used as a household industrial complex. Later, between 1983 and 1993, the building was used by the military commissariat. Since 1993, it has been functioning as a memorial museum of M. Tolebaev. The museum was opened on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the famous composer. The opening of the museum was attended by the composer, the Labor Man of Kazakhstan E. Rahmadiyev, the akim of the Taldykorgan region at that time S. Akymbekov, the akim of the Borlitobe district A. Turganbekov, the head of the district culture department R. Esdauletov, the director of the M. Tynyshpaev historical and local history museum K. Nurtaev and the first directors of the museum. G. Toleubaeva, cousin of Mukan Tolebayev, deceased K. The Duysembekovs made a great contribution. And in 1994, a monument was erected in front of the museum to commemorate the outstanding composer Mukan Tolebaev. The author of the copper sculpture is Edige Rakhmadiyev.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum has 1,422 materials of museum importance, of which 673 are the main fund, 749 are the auxiliary fund. M. Tolebaev is like a comet who has left an indelible mark on the art scene in his short life. He brought many classical works to the world of art, giving himself to a broad-eared, full-breathed, and deeply inspired image. One of them is the world-class opera \"Birzhan-Sara\". He went down in history as one of the founders of the clay school. The museum has more than 500 documents and things used by M. Tolebaev. The clothes he wore, his works of high scientific value, the original songs of the opera \"Birzhan-Sara\", \"Kesteli Omaral\", \"Tos, Meni Tos\", \"Jengyske\", his classical, symphonic works, songs and romances written by his own hands, his signature musical instruments. , etc. things are kept very carefully.<\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/4e9ca6de-a3fe-4b65-8dda-26c37b7797b9.jpeg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/cdb681df-ff44-4a87-a254-d381f863d2f5.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/0209f94d-5ed6-4831-ab23-a43ca435c370.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/7366cfdc-1366-46c0-8e3d-ac0a843c2f78.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6d457641-6717-4c0d-839c-99a4da2a75c7.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/380af885-6f2d-4475-88f5-d0342f83af52.jpeg"],"work_hours":"9:00 - 18:00","ticket_price":".","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"","addresscountry":"","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2136","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2136\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2139,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2136\/revisions\/2139"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2136"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2136"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
