Khaibulin, a school museum was established with the aim of systematizing the historical and cultural values of the Lepsy region. The collected exhibits were later, in 2019, transferred to a new building with the sponsorship of philanthropist B.K. Ospanov and opened as an independent museum for the village residents.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum building was originally constructed in 1980 and functioned as an industrial store until 1997. From 2000 to 2017, it served as a village mosque. According to Resolution No. 253 of the Akimat of Alakol District, Almaty Region, dated September 24, 2019, and Resolution No. 2 of the Akim of Almaty Region, A.G. Batalov, dated January 13, 2020, a decision was made to establish the \u201cLepsy Historical Museum.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum's exhibition consists of three thematic halls. The first is the \"Archaeology\" section, which covers periods from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. It features information about ancient people engaged in bronze smelting, who used special blowing devices to achieve high temperatures. Stone and clay molds were used to cast metal axes, knives, and spearheads. The section also illustrates the roles of women in ceramics and weaving.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next exhibit is dedicated to the formation of the Kazakh Khanate and the ethnic history of the Kazakh people. The Kazakh Khanate is a historical successor of earlier state formations that existed on the territory of Kazakhstan, and its emergence is closely linked with ethnic processes in the region. In 1465, at the initiative of Khans Kerei and Janibek, the Kazakh Khanate was founded. The exhibition features materials on the famous 18th-century military commander \u2013 Kanzhygaly Bogenbai Batyr, a notable military leader during the reign of Abylai Khan. It also presents the military path of Karakerei Kasabai Batyr, born in 1713 in the village of Koktuma, Alakol district.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second hall is dedicated to the topic \"Culture and Everyday Life of the Kazakh People.\" This section presents the historical and cultural features of the region and its natural and geographical conditions, which have been significant since ancient times. In particular, it emphasizes that the rich flora and fauna have long attracted human settlement, and it explores the historical interconnection between people and nature.<\/p>\r\n<p>The third hall is the \u201cIndependence Hall.\u201d This section tells the story of the Kazakh people's struggle and achievements on the path to gaining independence - a centuries-old dream. The proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan is presented as the logical result of the people's aspiration for freedom. In addition, the exhibition highlights the life and career of Serzhan Bostanuly Omarov, the first director of the regional specialized boarding school for gifted children in sports, located in the village of Lepsy.<\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/14fff73e-e5ce-4ff9-8a69-37f53c08cef7.jpg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/4eab2edb-f277-4716-bf4e-95e5f19030d2.jpg"],"work_hours":"9:00 - 18:00","ticket_price":".","is_active":"1","site":"","address":"","addresscity":"","addresscountry":"","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2154","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2154\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2157,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2154\/revisions\/2157"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2154"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2154"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
