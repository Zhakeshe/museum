This exhibition was highly appreciated by the Aktobe branch of the local history society and played a significant role in laying the foundation for the future museum in the regional center. Initially, the museum operated as a small school museum and was officially registered as the \"Local History Museum\" or the \"District Museum of Local Lore.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The founder and first director of the museum was David Trofimovich Temushka. From 1929 to 1945, he served as the museum's head and made a great contribution to its establishment and development. Starting in 1929, the museum was located in a small, unsuitable room measuring 6x6 meters. In 1934, it was moved to a former missionary church school building, and in December of the same year - to the former office of the Trade Syndicate on Lenin Street.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1946, by decision of the city executive committee, the building housing the museum was repurposed for vocational training. The new premises had a total area of 848.6 square meters, of which 563 square meters were allocated for thematic exhibitions. On December 30, 1965, the building underwent major renovations, and the design of the museum's exhibition was entrusted to a creative production workshop in the city of Orenburg.<\/p>\r\n<p>On June 6, 1967, the museum's grand opening took place, attended by Dinmukhamed Akhmetovich Kunaev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. During the 1960s and 1970s, significant achievements were made in the field of archaeology in Kazakhstan. During this period, the regional museum's collections were enriched with valuable artifacts from ancient times. In 1955, the well-known archaeologist V. S. Sorokin conducted research on historical sites in the river basins of Elek, Khobda, Emba (Zhem), Kargaly, and Or in the Aktobe region, gathering data on the material culture and economy of the Bronze Age population.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the 1970s, the Karatau Archaeological Detachment of the Institute of History, Archaeology, and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR, led by Candidate of Historical Sciences M. K. Kadyrbaev, conducted excavations in the region. As a result, gold items and household artifacts from the Scythian-Sarmatian period were found in the burial mounds of Besoba, Syntas, Kamyssai, and Zhalgyzoba, significantly enriching the museum's collection.<\/p>\r\n<p>In August 1980, Ryszhan Ilyaskyzy Ilyasova was appointed director of the museum. On September 10, 1981, the museum building was closed for major renovation. On July 5, 1985, the nature and pre-Soviet period sections were reopened, and a year later - the halls dedicated to Soviet society. The exhibition on heroic deeds during the Great Patriotic War was renewed and supplemented with personal belongings of Hero of the Soviet Union and cosmonaut V. I. Patsaev.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1999, the museum became a member of the international association \"Open Museum\" in Krasnoyarsk, and since 2003 - a member of the International Council of Museums (ICOM Kazakhstan). In 2013, the regional center for history, ethnography, and archaeology was incorporated into the museum, significantly expanding its research activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, the museum is located in a new building with a total area of 4,360.4 square meters, of which 1,425.8 square meters are dedicated to exhibition halls and 341.23 square meters are allocated for storage of the museum's collections. The museum houses a scientific library, storage rooms for artifacts, creative workshops, and exhibition halls equipped with modern multimedia technology. Visitors have access to LED screens, interactive virtual books, holographic systems, and information kiosks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Aktobe Regional Museum of History and Local Lore continues to modernize in accordance with contemporary standards while preserving historical traditions. To further develop its exhibition and research activities, the museum has established close cooperation with domestic and international museums and research institutions.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/fcef690b-db47-4380-a51f-1c3597f39a7c.jfif","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/ce1e7dca-917e-4057-912b-7f45195f9be0.png","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/bdd9a27b-b09e-4f49-8b85-d163837cb1aa.png","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/fc8ee9f4-d003-40f7-928c-24ae369ba48f.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/63d16d31-2c0f-44bf-82a3-5aed393c1b6e.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/0263182e-6645-4856-ac8e-e1fc7e146a57.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/5d1e8a26-ffba-4fdc-9293-ab5657c19237.JPG","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/f4911115-96e4-4ca3-9ea0-5e6dbbeb7fbb.JPG","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/cd2ba872-ea2d-4b4f-a9c5-c7484069edae.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/2c8a8c1a-17ac-48fc-9201-51befdd113f5.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/aa7659ce-052c-44d3-9151-4f1990158ae5.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/ade7b185-bc85-4af4-8b23-bb2ca40f24a1.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/61cf5b4c-b800-4a5a-b6d7-ee1ab60c0ea7.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/65e1e3a5-c13e-4b3a-b26d-0f8645fb9358.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/b42c4e50-d61f-4d3f-93ff-1f41945262ca.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/433d030e-1b09-4410-99d2-df45b8615e6d.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/94e0d6f8-19ac-4849-9141-df6c4f20da56.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/738d7079-a0aa-4a8e-b3d7-4cd5ce3b8011.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/f2b90769-d890-4a6c-b4e8-666190c548a7.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/68c14127-d892-4db3-95ac-acd464c5324f.jfif","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/c16c787a-c435-4525-90e7-c5b19da594ae.jfif"],"work_hours":"9:00 - 18:00","ticket_price":"\u043e\u0442 500 \u0442\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0435","is_active":"1","site":"www.aqtobe-museum.kz","address":"","addresscity":"\u0433.\u0410\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0435","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u0443\u043b. \u041e\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0443\u043b\u044b 3","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1104","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1104\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33944,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1104\/revisions\/33944"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1104"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=1104"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
