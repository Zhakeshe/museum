It was established on the initiative of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, as part of the implementation of the state program \u201cCultural Heritage\u201d and officially began operations by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 675 dated July 2, 2013.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The museum is located in the country\u2019s main historical and cultural space - Independence Square in Astana. Architecturally, the building is constructed in a modern style and harmoniously integrates with the \u201cKazakh Eli\u201d monument, the Palace of Independence, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, the \u201cHazret Sultan\u201d Mosque, and the Kazakh National University of Arts, forming a unique cultural ensemble.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The museum complex stands out for its scale and content. The total area of the building is 74,000 square meters. It consists of seven blocks with a tiered structure rising up to nine floors. The exhibition area exceeds 14,000 square meters and includes 20 galleries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The museum is equipped with advanced technology that meets international museum standards.
