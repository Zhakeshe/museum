The museum is dedicated to the life and creative legacy of Saken Seifullin - a prominent figure in early 20th-century Kazakh literature and culture, a poet, writer, playwright, publicist, and public and political figure. The institution functions as a scientific, educational, and cultural center aimed at preserving the historical memory of this national personality and fostering patriotism and respect for cultural values among younger generations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum was officially opened on January 21, 1988, by decree of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. Its main exposition is housed in an architectural monument - a wooden building constructed in the late 19th century. Built in 1846 at the initiative of local merchants from Akmolinsk, the building was originally used as a warehouse for goods. Between the 1920s and 1930s, Saken Seifullin himself lived and worked here, contributing significantly to the formation of Soviet Kazakh literature during this pivotal period. The house holds special historical and cultural significance as a place where a national figure of enduring influence lived and created. Prior to 1988, the building served as a kindergarten. Today, it is protected as a cultural heritage site and functions as a museum.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum also includes a second building that serves as its administrative office. This structure is another example of late 19th - early 20th-century wooden architecture, built in the eclectic style. Originally the home of physician Fyodor Ivanovich Blagoveshchensky, who lived and practiced there for nearly 40 years, the building later housed an accounting school and today accommodates the museum\u2019s administrative functions.<\/p>\r\n<p>The museum\u2019s permanent exhibition consists of six halls and holds over 7,000 artifacts. The core themes of the exhibition include:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. Personal belongings of Saken Seifullin - everyday items and objects used by the writer;<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Manuscripts and letters - original materials offering insight into his creative legacy;<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Books and publications - first editions and translations of Seifullin\u2019s literary works;<\/p>\r\n<p>4. Photographs and archival documents - materials illustrating historical events and key biographical moments;<\/p>\r\n<p>5. Visual art and sculpture - paintings, sculptures, and commemorative works dedicated to Seifullin\u2019s life and achievements.<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to its exhibition activities, the museum conducts scholarly research and organizes cultural and literary events. It collaborates with schools and universities, offering lectures, public lessons, literary evenings, conferences, and temporary exhibitions to promote Seifullin studies and literary scholarship. Museum staff are also involved in gathering oral histories, conducting field expeditions, acquiring new artifacts, and reviving interest in cultural heritage.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Saken Seifullin Museum is not merely a literary-historical archive; it serves as a modern educational and spiritual space that fosters national identity and cultural continuity. Future plans include expanding the museum\u2019s digital platform, enriching its database, strengthening international academic partnerships, and enhancing educational programming through museum pedagogy initiatives.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/a0f59d15-ce06-4c38-ae50-1c480f3a1e16.jpeg","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/8ccbe92d-11e1-4aef-8e0e-8d940d93191e.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/118d32ea-4f50-4e54-a99a-bd2318909894.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/9bf197c4-71fd-4873-aa49-9e1cddc2ba6a.jpg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/d772365d-1a25-4655-a67a-efaa63d016e6.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/6a828f34-33fe-4825-b76d-1c83ff43cfa2.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/10693e94-9a32-459c-86b8-6de48db00a3e.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/25763e4a-0ac1-44e4-9215-71edb20457f9.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/0dd23798-6047-479a-a3e5-72b0cc33e750.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/dd8ecfdb-35dc-4df6-9522-1f7bdac99975.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/c73a4646-3246-46db-9d7a-ebfc451af19a.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/0e91fed6-f24f-4a17-823a-06b871306cae.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/650f41f8-886f-45ba-bd35-26b1bc47301a.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/2224e123-65f6-489e-9b1c-3a48ed45b424.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/62e371e8-b38d-4bf9-b984-9fe2ac132d02.jpeg","https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/57799e3f-e314-483e-9098-a45eae33e412.jpeg"],"work_hours":"09:00-18:00","ticket_price":"500 \u0442\u0433","is_active":"1","site":"www.astanamuseums.kz","address":"","addresscity":"\u0433.\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u0410\u0443\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430 20 \u0410","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2508","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2508\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32642,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/2508\/revisions\/32642"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2508"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=2508"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
