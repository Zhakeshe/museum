The complex is included in the \u201cSacred Geography of Kazakhstan\u201d program, implemented under the initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Currently, large-scale restoration and landscaping works are underway, with completion scheduled for the end of 2025.<\/p>\r\n<p>Doszhan Ishan Kashakuly (birth name - Dosmukhammed) was an outstanding representative of the religious and educational movement on the Kazakh steppe in the 19th century. He was a thinker, mentor, and spiritual leader of the people. At the age of 16, he undertook his first pilgrimage, where he received religious education in Turkey and Mecca, deeply studying the foundations of Islam. Upon returning to his homeland at age 17 with the title of \"young hazret,\" he built a mosque and began teaching students. Doszhan Ishan is considered a prominent figure who made a significant contribution to the spiritual development of Kazakh society and to organizing pilgrimages among Kazakhs.<\/p>\r\n<p>The restoration project for the Doszhan Hazret mosque-madrasa involves several major areas of construction and conservation work:<\/p>\r\n<p>Mosque Building: The historical building\u2019s original foundation is preserved, reinforced with a concrete base, and topped with a modern roof. Original wall paintings and decorative elements are retained as much as possible in their authentic form.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mazar and Mausoleum: The grave of Doszhan Ishan is undergoing full reconstruction. Skilled craftsmen from Aktau are carving natural white stone, decorating the mausoleum walls with national ornaments. The top of the mausoleum will be crowned with a dome and crescent moon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well Discovery: During the restoration, an ancient stone well was discovered in front of the mausoleum. Inside, household items and religious artifacts from the 19th century were found. This archaeological discovery greatly enhances the historical value of the complex.<\/p>\r\n<p>Infrastructure: A hotel complex for pilgrims is being built on the territory, including a prayer room (namazkhana), a canteen, guest rooms, and a small museum. A 6-meter-wide pedestrian pathway with lighting is being laid, apple trees have been planted, and a local spring is being landscaped, making the site attractive for ecological and spiritual tourism.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Doszhan Hazret complex is not only a religious site but also a vital center for preserving national historical memory and fostering spiritual and moral values among youth. In the future, it is expected to become a venue for scholarly conferences, religious and educational gatherings, and a significant destination for religious and cultural tourism.<\/p>\r\n<p>The restoration of the Doszhan Ishan mosque-madrasa is a crucial step in preserving the spiritual and historical heritage of the Kazakh people and passing it on to future generations.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","logo":"https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/73a017cf-9a02-48d2-934a-8f212b1198f8.webp","museum_type":"","multimedia":["https:\/\/crm.e-museum.kz\/emuseum\/museum\/MuseumGal\/5502daa2-fb37-41eb-a7c8-945829415fc1.webp"],"work_hours":"","ticket_price":"","is_active":"1","site":"www.aqtobe-museum.kz","address":"","addresscity":"\u0422\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0428\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0443\u043a","addresscountry":"\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d","addresspostalcode":"","addressstate":"","addressstreet":"\u0410\u049b\u0442\u0430\u0441 52","pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1488","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/museum"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1488\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32478,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/museum\/1488\/revisions\/32478"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1488"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/e-museum.kz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/region?post=1488"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
