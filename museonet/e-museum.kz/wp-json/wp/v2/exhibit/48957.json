The lower end is designed as a V-shaped cut, which allowed the arrowhead to be firmly attached to the shaft of the arrow using a strap or sinew. This design ensured a secure attachment and effective weaponry for hunting or combat purposes.<br \/>\nThe material is dense bone, well-polished during processing. The surface of the item is smooth, with a natural ivory hue. Such tips were widely used by nomadic tribes: they were lighter than metal ones and were made faster, but they still retained their sharpness and functionality.<br \/>\nLocation: Koksaykorum Kerbulak District of Zhetysus Region-12. 2023 (1-Kurgan South).<br \/>\nDate: Iron Age<br \/>\nTechnique: hand-made.<br \/>\nSize: 3&#215;1
