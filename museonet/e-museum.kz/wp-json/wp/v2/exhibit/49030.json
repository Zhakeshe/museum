The gold elements have a distinctive flattened round shape, with holes for the string to pass through. They are interspersed with darker inserts, which create a contrast and enhance the decorative appeal of the piece.<br \/>\nThese pieces served both aesthetic and symbolic purposes:<br \/>\nAesthetic: they served as a striking element of the costume, emphasizing the elegance and status of the wearer.<br \/>\nSymbolic: gold was associated with wealth, power, and sacred force, and could act as a protective amulet.<br \/>\nSuch finds are found in archaeological sites associated with the ancient Turkic culture, reflecting the high level of jewelry craftsmanship and artistic traditions of the time.<br \/>\nLocation: Zhetysu Region, Kerbulak District,
