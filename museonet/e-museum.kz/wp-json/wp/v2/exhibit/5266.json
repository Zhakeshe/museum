A total of six men are shown: five of them are attentively listening to a man standing before them, dressed in a long coat and headwear &#8212; clearly a representative of the administration or an engineer. The composition emphasizes the importance of communication, mutual understanding, and labor organization within the Soviet industrial environment. The work is executed in the linocut technique, which enables the creation of sharp graphic contrasts and expressive silhouettes. This piece is a valuable example of artistic interpretation of labor themes in Soviet graphic art.<br \/>\nDating: 1971<br \/>\nRegion: Kazakhstan<br \/>\nMaterial \/ Technique: Linocut<br
