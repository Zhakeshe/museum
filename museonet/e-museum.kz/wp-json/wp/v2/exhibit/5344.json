In the foreground, workers-welders are depicted engaged in assembly tasks. In the background, plumes of smoke rise from the chimneys of the future facility. The artist conveys the spirit of the industrialization era, combining themes of labor, technology, and progress. The work is executed in the etching technique &#8212; a classical graphic method based on acid-etching an image onto a metal plate followed by printing. This technique allows for high detail and compositional depth. The piece serves as an artistic reflection of industrial themes and the labor ideology of the Soviet era.<br \/>\nDating: 1978<br \/>\nRegion: Kazakhstan<br \/>\nMaterial \/ Technique: Etching<br
