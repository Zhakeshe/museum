These plates could be used as pendants or patches on clothing, secured to the fabric through stitching or metal fasteners.<br \/>\nFour small cuboid elements, likely made of stone or metal. They could serve as beads or decorative inserts, complementing the main ornamentation of the clothing.<br \/>\nSuch decorations had both aesthetic and symbolic functions. They emphasized the social status of the owner, served as amulets, and simultaneously reflected the artistic traditions of the nomadic societies of the Iron Age.<br \/>\nLocation: Zhetysu Region,
