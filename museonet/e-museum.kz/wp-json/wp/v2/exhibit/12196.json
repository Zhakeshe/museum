The inside was usually filled with heavy materials such as sand or lead. The flexible part connecting the handle and the head was made of leather. This is the main feature of the shokpar. The flexibility of the neck increased the force of the blow and added maneuverability.<br \/>\nThis weapon was used in close combat, by both mounted and foot soldiers. The leather head allowed for strong strikes, while the flexible neck amplified the impact. Compared to metal shokpars, it was lighter and more flexible. It was effective in injuring the enemy and limiting their movement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center
