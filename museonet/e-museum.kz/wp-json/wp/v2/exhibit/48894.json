In the central part, there is a rectangular cutout that extends downward and forms a U-shape. The edge of the cutout is decorated with decorative embroidery, featuring patterns of brown and green threads that represent plant motifs, leaves, and flowers. The embroidery is complemented by red thread that runs through the patterns.<br \/>\nOn the opposite edge of the cutout, there are small elements that mimic black and blue beads. On this kimeshek, the beads play a special decorative and symbolic role. They are embroidered along the edge of the neckline, opposite the central part, in small rows or as individual dots.<br \/>\nThe beads are imitated using a fine-grained technique that creates the effect of sewn-on grainy elements. In terms of texture, they resemble usak monshak (small glass beads).<br \/>\nBlack and blue beads predominate. The black beads create a contrast with the white fabric and emphasize the graphic nature of the ornament. The blue beads add freshness and sacredness to the composition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center
