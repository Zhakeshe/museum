The surface of the mirror is covered with a layer of corrosion and oxides, but in ancient times it was carefully polished and had a reflective surface.<br \/>\nThese mirrors were not only used for personal hygiene and decoration during the Early Iron Age, but also had a sacred significance. They could be used in rituals and were symbols of the sun, light, and protection.<br \/>\nThe material and shape of this object allow us to classify it as a household and cult object from the Iron Age, reflecting the level of development of metallurgy and the artistic traditions of ancient society.<br \/>\nLocation: Zhetysuskaya region, Kerbulak district, Koksaykorum-7. 2023.
