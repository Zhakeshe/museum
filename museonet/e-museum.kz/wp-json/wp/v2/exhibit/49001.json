The walls of the pot are quite thick, which contributed to its durability and longevity in everyday use. The surface of the pottery shows signs of firing, with patches of different shades ranging from light brown to dark gray, which were caused by uneven exposure to heat.<br \/>\nJudging by its shape and volume, the pot could have been used for cooking and storing food or liquid. Its simplicity and lack of decorative elements suggest a practical purpose. The presence of a small protrusion on the side may indicate a functional detail for convenient holding or attachment of the vessel.<br \/>\nSuch finds are often encountered in archaeological sites and provide valuable insights into the daily lives and household practices of ancient communities.<br \/>\nLocation: Zhetysu Region, Kerbulak
