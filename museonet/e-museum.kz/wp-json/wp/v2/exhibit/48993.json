The surface of the bowl is smooth, without any ornamental decorations, and has a natural shade of burnt clay, ranging from light brown to ocher. The walls show signs of hand-shaped and fired, which is typical for early Iron Age ceramics.<br \/>\nThese bowls were used for eating and drinking, and they may also have had a practical or ritual purpose. The simplicity of their shape and lack of decoration suggest that they were intended for practical use. These types of finds are common in Iron Age archaeological sites and provide insights into the development of ceramic production and the daily lives of ancient societies.<br \/>\nLocation: Zhetysu
