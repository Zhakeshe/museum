In the central section, three young people in work uniforms are depicted singing, with a guitar in hand &#8212; a symbol of friendship, creativity, and the spirit of youth. The left section shows the construction of residential buildings, emphasizing urban development and a surge in construction. The right section features scenes of agricultural labor: fields, smoking chimneys, and high-voltage power lines &#8212; all reflecting the industrialization of rural work. The piece is executed in the technique of color etching, which gives the image expressiveness, a rich palette, and depth. The artwork is an example of Socialist Realism, conveying the ideals of labor, progress, and harmony between youth and society.<br \/>\nDating: 1979<br \/>\nRegion: Kazakhstan<br \/>\nMaterial \/
