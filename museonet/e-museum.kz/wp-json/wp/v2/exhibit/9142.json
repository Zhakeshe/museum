The axe blade is triangular in shape and decorated on both sides with leaf-like patterns. It is securely attached to a wooden handle through a socket. Decorative metal studs made of white metal are embedded on the upper part of the handle. The lower part is adorned with a thin sheet of metal, fastened with small nails. A double-edged dagger, 30 cm in length, is inserted into this section. The dagger&#8217;s handle is made of wood and measures 13 cm. This weapon is valuable both for its dual functionality and its artistic
