On the left is a rider in traditional clothing and headgear, holding the reins in a calm yet composed posture. On the right is a warrior in armor and a helmet, holding a bow in his right hand, conveying tension and readiness for action. The horses are rendered with particular attention to anatomical detail and movement, their swift pace emphasized by energetic brushstrokes and a rich color palette dominated by cool and muted tones. The composition reflects the drama of the moment, combining historical accuracy with artistic expression.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center
