The bases of the arrowheads are cylindrical and have a socket-like design, which was intended for attachment to the arrow shaft. This design allowed for a secure attachment of the arrowhead and its use in both combat and hunting. The surface of the items has traces of corrosion and a reddish-brown coating, which is typical for ancient iron that has been in the ground for a long time. Despite this, the arrowheads are well preserved and provide insight into the typology of Saka small arms.<br \/>\nThese arrowheads were widely used by the Saka tribes, as they were lightweight and easy to mass-produce, making them the primary weapon for both horsemen and infantry. Their shape not only provided them with a strong piercing power, but also made them easy to retrieve from the quiver, which was crucial in combat situations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center
