In the foreground, figures of people are shown retrieving the catch, while in the background, a boatman and houses along the shore are visible. The composition reflects the calm and rhythm of rural life, portraying harmony between humans and the natural environment. The work is executed in the techniques of etching and aquatint, which allowed the artist to convey the finest nuances of light, shadow, and texture. These techniques create a vivid atmosphere and enhance the realism of the scene. The piece is a valuable graphic representation of Kazakh daily life and traditional labor.<br \/>\nDating: 1971<br \/>\nRegion: Kazakhstan<br \/>\nMaterial \/ Technique: Etching, aquatint<br
