A traditional Asian cast metal cooking pot with a semi-round bottom. Among the Kazakhs, the cauldron occupies one of the most important places among other dishes.

The cauldron is cast from cast iron in the form of a hemisphere with two handles for easy grip. The cauldron is mounted on a tripod (ush butty oshak), and decorated with ornamental patterns.
