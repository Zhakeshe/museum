It consists of individual lattice sections called kanat, which are connected to each other. Each kanat is formed from diagonally intersecting wooden slats known as saganak, allowing the structure to be easily expanded or collapsed.<br \/>\n This design provides mobility and convenience in transporting the yurt, as well as the ability to adjust its size. All elements are fastened together using durable leather straps or nails, ensuring both strength and flexibility. This unique architectural system reflects the Kazakh people&#8217;s adaptation to a nomadic lifestyle and has been used for many centuries.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center
