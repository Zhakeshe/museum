At the center of each motif is a six-pointed star embroidered with red thread. Inside the large floral design is a rectangle framed by a four-channel border, measuring 4 cm wide and 8.5 cm long. The flower heads are embroidered with yellow thread, and the stems and leaves are green, forming a total of 18 ornaments. The edges of the scarf are decorated with green fringe, with tassels measuring 7 cm in length. The overall dimensions of the scarf are 63\u00d756 cm.
