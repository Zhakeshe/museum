Along the top, center, and bottom edges runs a border 0.2 cm wide. All three borders are equally adorned with fine wire in the center and filigree threads along the sides. The inner field of the plate is decorated with granulation arranged in two rows. In the center of the granulation is a setting, the sides of which are decorated with filigree threads. The granule opposite the setting is missing. At both ends of the bracelet, two pairs of teardrop-shaped settings for inlay are preserved. The setting is decorated with filigree threads.<\/p>\n<p>The clasp is constructed so that one end has three loops and the other two; when closed, they form a through-hole for the clasp to pass through. The clasp itself is a bent wire with a rounded tip, decorated with fine granulation. A bridge is located at the center of one of the loops, which holds the clasp in place, thereby securing it.<\/p>\n<p>At a distance of 2.6 cm from one end, the bracelet is broken into two parts, and on both sides, two through holes have been made, presumably traces of repair by the craftsman. The inner side of the bracelet is smooth and well finished.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","ast-disable-related-posts":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-4)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-4)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-4)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"footnotes":""},"historical_period":[],"exhibit_category":[169],"exhibit_material":[337],"exhibit_theme":[1249],"exhibit_technique":[],"class_list":["post-5986","exhibit","type-exhibit","status-publish","hentry","exhibit_category-68da500e13c1487f5-en","exhibit_material-68da51787197ead17-en","exhibit_theme-68da51c59749e8a9b-en"],"aioseo_notices":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":5986,"kk":5984,"ru":5985},"original_id":"10522","author_ru":"Zh.
