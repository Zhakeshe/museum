The length of the plates ranges from 10 to 12 cm, and the width varies from 1 to 2.5 cm. They are carefully nailed around the perimeter of the chest, particularly at the corners, giving the piece an elegant appearance.<br \/>\nThe lid is attached to the main body with two metal hinges and also features special fittings for a lock.
